# dartclojure

App to convert dart code with flutter widgets creation into
ClojureDart.

## Why it is not full dart->clojure converter

Converted code would not be idiomatic, so I see little value in doing this.

But rewriting code with widgets is a routine part in most of the
caseses (when you do not use [helpers macro][1]). 

This utility converts dart code like this:

```dart 
Center(
  child: Text(
    _active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive',
    style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 32.0, color: Colors.white),
  ),
);
```

into:

```clojure
(m/Center
 :child 
 (m/Text
  (if _active "Active" "Inactive")
  :style (m/TextStyle :fontSize 32.0 :color m.Colors/white)))
```

## Supported

- constructors invocation;
- static, factory methods invocation;
- named arguments;
- (typed) lists;
- constants (only without pprint mode);
- ternary operators;
- lambdas arguments;
- comments (will be removed);

## Not supported

- lambdas body;
- expressions (only ternary is supported);
- complex ternary expressions;
- class declarations;
- methods declarations;

## How to use

There are two options now: jar file or jvm repl.
